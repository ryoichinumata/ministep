<p class="blog-intro">
                    Diet, studying, exercise, journaling…<br/>
                    "This time I'll keep it going!" — and then three days later, it's already over.<br/>
                    We've all been there.
                </p>

<h2>Blaming yourself for quitting makes restarting harder</h2>
<p>
                        When a streak breaks, many people immediately tell themselves: "I knew I had no willpower" or "I failed again."
                    </p>
<p>
                        But from a habit-building perspective,<br/>
                        what matters isn't "never breaking the streak" —<br/>
                        it's <strong>"being able to come back even after it breaks."</strong>
                    </p>
<p>
                        The more you blame yourself, the higher the bar to restart becomes,
                        and the longer the gap before you try again.
                    </p>

<h2>Look at habits by total count, not streak length</h2>
<p>Over the course of a year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Person A: Does something every day for 30 days in January, then stops completely</li>
<li>Person B: Does it 3 days, skips 2, does it 3 more — loosely repeating all year</li>
</ul>
<p>
                        Person A looks more "impressive" at first glance,<br/>
                        but Person B's <strong>total count</strong> often ends up higher.
                    </p>
<p>
                        At MiniStep, we care more about "did you take another step?" than "did you keep the streak?"
                    </p>

<h2>3 ways to make coming back easier</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Make day one of restarting ridiculously tiny</strong><br/>
                            For exercise, just one push-up. For studying, just open the book. "This small is actually fine" is exactly the right size.
                        </li>
<li>
<strong>Focus on the fact that you came back, not why you stopped</strong><br/>
                            "Look at me, I started again" — give yourself credit for that alone. It lowers the psychological cost of the next step.
                        </li>
<li>
<strong>Track total days, not just the streak</strong><br/>
                            When streaks break, motivation can crash to zero. Keeping a running total of "how many days I've done this" helps you keep going past a broken streak.
                        </li>
</ol>

<h2>MiniStep wants to be a place you can always come back to</h2>
<p>
                        MiniStep challenges are small, one-a-day actions.<br/>
                        Busy stretches where you don't open the app for a while? That's completely fine.
                    </p>
<p>
                        On the day you feel like it again, open the app and take one more tiny MiniStep.<br/>
                        That's all it takes to restart a habit.
                    </p>
<p>
                        Instead of blaming yourself for stopping,<br/>
                        praise yourself for <span>coming back</span>.<br/>
                        Let's keep building gentle habits together with MiniStep.
                    </p>
