<p class="blog-intro">
                    When you think "I wish I had more confidence,"<br/>
                    it's easy to feel like you need to achieve something big.<br/>
                    But honestly, the number of small promises you've kept matters far more.
                </p>

<h2>Self-confidence = your trust balance with yourself</h2>
<p>
                        Self-confidence can be thought of as your "trust balance with yourself."<br/>
                        It's the accumulation of: how often have you actually followed through on what you decided to do?
                    </p>
<p>
                        Even when others praise you,<br/>
                        if you're not keeping your own promises,<br/>
                        some part of you whispers "maybe I'm all talk."
                    </p>

<h2>Big goals create bigger "betrayals"</h2>
<p>
                        When you make big promises to yourself — "study 1 hour every day," "run 10km daily" —
                        the damage when you don't follow through is also big.
                    </p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blaming yourself for not following through</li>
<li>Being afraid to make another promise because you might break it again</li>
</ul>
<p>
                        And your "trust balance" keeps shrinking.
                    </p>

<h2>MiniStep's guide to building self-confidence with small promises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Set promises so small they're almost funny</strong><br/>
                            Examples: just open the book, just one push-up, just walk to the front door for fresh air.
                        </li>
<li>
<strong>Actually record whether you did it</strong><br/>
                            Add a checkmark, circle a calendar date, tap "Mark done" in MiniStep…<br/>
                            Making it visible builds a growing pile of "proof I did it."
                        </li>
<li>
<strong>On bad days, decide your next step instead of having a post-mortem</strong><br/>
                            A long reflection session does less good than deciding: "tomorrow I'll at least do this one thing." It slows the drain on your trust balance.
                        </li>
</ol>

<h2>MiniStep is a "small promise machine"</h2>
<p>
                        MiniStep's draw suggests one small promise per day.<br/>
                        You can forget sometimes. You don't have to be perfect. That's okay.
                    </p>
<p>
                        What matters is
                        <strong>keeping and re-keeping your small promises, over and over again.</strong>
                    </p>
<p>
                        That's what gradually turns into the feeling of "I think I trust myself a little more than before."
                    </p>
<p>
                        Small promises over big wins.<br/>
                        Start that first step with today's MiniStep.
